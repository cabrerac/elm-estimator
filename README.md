# Explainable Learning Models - Estimator

This project builds the backend for the Explainable Learning Models (ELM) system based on a Data-Oriented Architecture.

The ELM system parametrises learning models using a Data-Oriented Architecture. The system also offers a question/answering interface where users can ask about the parametrisation process 
of the learning model using natural language.
